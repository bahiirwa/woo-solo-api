This plugin provides integration of the SOLO service with WooCommerce store.

## Description

Woo Solo Api plugin will integrate with your checkout process, and will send the API request with
the order details to the SOLO service which will in turn create a PDF of the invoice or order on your SOLO dashboard.

Additionally, the invoice or order will be stored on your site, and you'll have the option of sending this PDF as a separate
mail to the client.

There is an entire options page where you can specify the details of the order or the invoice such as unit measure, payment
options, language of the invoice, currency and others.

The plugin is translated to Croatian, since the SOLO service is primarily used by Croatian users.
